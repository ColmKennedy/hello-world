# hello-world
Hello everybody!

I am Colm, I am in the beginning stages of self-learning Java. I have mainly been learning via HyperSkill.
HyperSkill is an online curriculum of lessons, which guides the user through projects and lessons on various programing languages.
I have found it incredibly informative, but I would love to hear suggestions on other methods I could use to learn Java.
Much of the work I will be posting will be created through the assistance of HyperSkill for the time being, but using my own code.

I am interested in learning Java, because my close friend is a data scientist, and we believe Java could help us to implement some of his work. If you have any suggestions for projects for us, I would love to hear them!

Currently, I am preparing for a Cyber Security course to begin my career in technology. For me, Java is somewhat of a hobby at this point, but I am hoping to eventually apply these skills to my future ventures in my career.

I love video games, and have vast interests in space exploration, philosophy, and psychology. I am also intrigued by Artificial Intelligence, and the upcoming, exciting applications for it.
