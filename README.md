# hello-world
Hello everybody!

I am Colm, I am a Rutgers student pursuing a degree in psychology and data science. Currently, I am mainly working in R and Python. I am also fairly proficient in Java. I am using Github mainly to create a place to store and share my work, but increasingly finding it very useful for version control on group projects at Rutgers. Github has not been covered in my formal education, so I am learning mostly from the documentation. 

I love video games, and have vast interests in space exploration, philosophy, and psychology. I am also intrigued by Artificial Intelligence, and the upcoming, exciting applications for it.
